A certain dynamic became almost a habit for m, unfortunately. I am waking, thinking about all of the good stuff I am going to do today. Then, some doubts come to my mind- "Does *it* really worth it?", "What about the thing *X* you said you will do and you know is good? Or *Y*, or *Z*, why aren't you doing all of them?", "You know, you should take a break from the world and analyze deeply its meaning and the best approach to living on this little Earth, in the long term, mid term, short term and derive from it the actions for the minutes to come", "You said to *$\alpha$* that you plan to learn *a*, and to *$\beta$* that you plan to learn *b*, and you do want to know the ideas behind these subjects. But what about this *c* thing that I need to do before meeting *$\gamma$*, it will be great to have it done perfectly, as you know how to do.", and so on. And my brain explodes. And in such a moment of confusion, a little thought is crawling the back of the mind - "Maybe there is a new episode from this podcast you like, *u*? Or *t*?". Sometimes the thought is even with less words, just an urge, a feeling of something missing in my hand, some beautiful red rectangle, or a blue-ish bird, or a blue rectangle which invites you in, or reaing the news at some platform or another about some issues or another. And in my mind, this voice has a much easier way of gratification - it is a matter of seconds, or minutes, to gratify this urge- to just check. The deep thoughts feel like very hard to solve, and I know they will be solved afterwards. And then, in a moment of weakness, I just enter the phone to check this thing. Sometimes it is for something "good", like answering a friend on Whatsapp or scheduling something using emails. Nevertheless, once I am inside, I am trapped.

And it is really sad, because somehow this little dive became a true drowning, lasting between 20 minutes to 4 hours in a row (!). It is absorving any youth, any health, any meaning, any happy feelings nor sad, any original or productive thoughts. Sometimes there are actually some interesting thoughts during this drowning, but for the most part the brain becomes almost totally passive, and being submissimive to what the finger will reveal next on the little screen.
Really, a life could be past this way. I am pretty ashamed to count the number of hours I have spent on these platforms.

Many people have gone through a similar situation. There are several billions of phone users around the world, who probably experience similar difficulties.

I hope there would be phones, tablets and computers with an option
