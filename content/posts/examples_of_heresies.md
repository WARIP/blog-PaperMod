After reading Paul Graham's essay 'What You Can't Say', I began reflecting on the uncomfortable ideas that we may encounter in our lives. Sometimes, these ideas can be so irksome to certain groups that merely thinking about them becomes unbearable. As our minds attempt to distract ourselves with other thoughts, these uncomfortable ideas continue to linger in the background, vying for our attention.

Right now I see a good definition for this kind of thoughts- ideas that make some people's identity to collapse, in their mind, where the thinker knows it too. What I mean by that is that some people (which may be a one person, up to some large percentage of the world's population) are building their identity and their way of justifying their actions, "feel of meaning" and their world view.

There is the question of talking about these heresies, and in the essay PG describes the problem of talking about it versus not, and he suggests to not speak about this in public. But, here I will try to actually speak about them in public, with a special shield - of writing many heresies at once from various points of view. We'll see in the future if that was a good idea.

- There are smart people, and there are non smart people. It is not a binary classification, but there may be a huge difference between two people relative to many areas of skill, expertise and logical thinking abilities.
- There is a huge genetic component to the smartness mentioned above. There is also a huge component of learning from the parents and the environment in the young ages.
- Technology in many cases may worsen the non-physical conditions of living. For example, the huge damages caused by smartphone usage.
- There are "DL researchers" that don't actually do original work that is worth a paper, and they just find a combination of the "Lego bricks" that shows some good looking results after running on a GPU cluster, even thohugh they can't really understand deeply the subject. 
- You can't learn what you want by yourself. Learning alone from a book without talking to anyone is 10X less productive than taking a course where one needs to solve exercises and get grades on them, and speaking with other students in a target-driven way as of learning to an exam. And this method may be 100X less productive then "making things" with passion which are based on these ideas (so one has a deep motivation to understand what one needs to make), coupled with having a feeling of competition or socializing based on this with real consequences of the results.
- There are people who are not seeing the world from the view of education and the need to be smart, and can live generally nice lives.
- One can waste a huge chunk of his life listening to dumb people or ideas, without realising it.
- It is okay to see that you are not smart enough but still has some original view of the world, and handle these two opposing ideas- do everything you can to listen to smarter then you people and accepting new ideas, but without a blind trust.
- There are mathematicians, physicists and makers (and alike) that are 1000X more inteligent then anyone else, but they don't show and are busy in doing. Most of the information one hears is not from them, and is of much less "worth" (in the sense of bringing actual happiness and understanding of the world) then the 1000X people.
- Smart people (even 1000X) can be wrong and very human-like irrational, and it is important and very useful to be attentive to the glimpses of it.
- Money is not good or bad, it is a part of a game humans are playing today, with a part of their physical property and work attached to. There are inifinitely many ways to play, each with its own mechanism following. In general, games which allow more information to flow can be better, but there are more properties that should be defined and are not defined explicitly in the public discourse (in this axiomatic-approach sense).
- Conzensuses have a strange dynamic.
- One usually estimates totally incorrectly the implications of his actions and have distorted view of time and happiness (in the sense of the logic in preventing "time-waste").
- Many people go to protests and fight almost religously in the name of some "cause" based on some perceived evidence, where they actually never researched the subject in a logical way, didn't read laws or history involved, and are mostly fed by fragments of words and sentences they hear from other influencing people. Moreover, they fight for no utility, and usually to their disadvantage, where the idea will actually hurt them and the people which are important to them in the long term.
- Not learning from history's lessons makes someone's opinions much less credible. Not seeing one's real flaws without aggresive defence makes someone's opinions much less credible. Not thinking in an axiomatic way makes someone's opinions much less credible. Not thinking in a scientific and data driven way makes someone's opinions much less credible.
- There is almost nothing worth enough to lose sleep for (in the measure space of possible events). This is $(100-\eps)%$ correct when there are no real human lives on the line. This is $(100-\eps)%$ correct when one loses hours of sleep for more then a few days in a year.

- The people living in China should understand that the bubble they live in, especially the gov's careful restriction and censorship on the internet, cause them great harm, and also to everyone else in the world.
- Education in the general sense is super important to be done good, with intelligent (analytically and emotionally) people. Really. And there are cultures and groups of people which don't realise it, and think that the cause for their relative poverty is some form of injustice.
- Many arabs who are saying "Free Palestine" are not aware of the history of the jewish people and the hatred they have got almost everywhere they were it (which had an extreme expression in the Holocoast)
- Many israeli-jewish people are not aware of the amount of control used on an innocent civilian population without its people's will, that is applied to non-jewish people living nearby.
