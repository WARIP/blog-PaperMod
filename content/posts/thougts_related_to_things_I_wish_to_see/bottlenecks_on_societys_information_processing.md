It may be better for a group of people to learn how to collaborate. More specifically, to impose rules and invest capital in an organized way to achieve common goals, such as ensuring energy supply (by building a dam or a nuclear reactor), settling on a land, ensuring security or creating new products and services that become profitable if a large group of people invest together, enjoying economy of scale and more. In the case of imposing rules and investing capital in the level of the government (1M+ people collaborating), I think we have some room for improvement.
There is no absoulute "good", unfortunately. But, we can look from each person's subjective point of view. Now I will speak for myself (which is the animal I know the best), and we will generalize from there. 
A comment- here I am using the notion of utility, which should be formulated properly, maybe in a another post.
Ideally, there would be a benevolent entity with infinite power and bandwidth, having a full view of each one's private feelings and an understanding of the dynamics of the world (and of people's minds). 
It would have a way to view my mind and body, and it will compute/predict for all of the possible interactions with any possible group of entities the distribution of utility (or compute it exactly, if there will be inifinite accuracy). Then, it would seek to have those interactions with the best utility.
It would make estimates on the effect of each policy on each person for each amount of investment on behalf of the person, and seek
