I have a theory- the higher the bandwidth between agents and rational-enough information processing, the better they are able to collaborate. Also in humans, assuming thte level of rationality of humans.
So the main problem we have is the bandwidth. When I say information, I mean a real connection, trying to get into another's head and have a fruitful disctussion, especially on topics with no initial agreement.
There may be a better introduction with smarter sounding justification, for the following idea- I want the random walk on the graph of communicating humans to converge faster to the uniform distribution. In other words, to make the graph with higher edge expansion. This will yield a higher convergence rate of a random walk to the uniform distribution. Meaning- relevant information* will flow faster to all of the vertices/humans. 
Relevant information may include not just regular conversations, but also harder conversations, with different points of view (but here comes the question how to incentivize this without allowing manipulating the system...).
