Let us assume that we would like to see what we consider as a flourish of society. There is some argument here which I don't write right now, for why to consider challenges (or why not) and what does that exactly mean (a short argument will be that it gives some kind of an empowering feeling, thinking of living in this certain kind of future, and there may be also this feeling of status, even though I would like not to have it).

Somewhat abstractly, some main goals I find fascinating to get to from where we are (they might be written vaguely) (take the word "meaningful" as "felt/perceived as meaningful", which is still a vague adjective):
1. Have the most efficient and mostly-fun ways of learning meaningful information, so to have a more deep and colored mind.
2. Have the most efficient and mostly-fun ways of learning handling emotionally in a meaningful way 
3. (which is more subconcious than cortex-related information).
4. Have the decision making of any influential and intelligent "entity" (human or artificial) be sustainably aligned as possible with the suite of needs of the highest number possible of humans (including me:)).
5. Having information and communication systems which allow coordinated actions in the most powerful way (e.g. much better systems to govern society then those exist today)
6. Having humanity and the animal kingdom survive as long as possible.
7. Have humans get to live on other planets.
8. Having feeling loved by everyone in a basic sense been everyone's experience
9. Having all humans to understand deeply (even if without words) the nature of their and of others minds.
10. Having the existence of a great mutual loving relationship be everyone's opportunity.
11. Having cures for diseases which cause a great prolonged suffer.
12. Have a nutritional and tasty diet with suffering of other capable-of-suffer entites kept as low as possible (in particular, having artificial nutritional and tasty meat world-wide used).
