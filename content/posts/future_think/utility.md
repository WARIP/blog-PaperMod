When I try to think on ways to derive the "best" strategy to live or to govern society and economy, the notion of utility comes in very fast, and then the discussion gets a bit stuck- what does it even mean? How could one measure the utility gained from some action or interaction? Looking in the perspective of time, how could one take into account the so many different moments and feelings felt during one's life?
I was very puzzled by this, until now.
I have an explanation for this notion that seems intuitive but unexplainable, with our current language (in the broad sense of language).

There is no "me" (that's not a new discovery, anyway). There is a point of view, at each moment (also the word moment is a bit puzzling, maybe we'll try to address it later). This point of view have some vivd construction/simulation of the world (which is done also with using some fragments of data gathered by the senses). This point of view has a feeling. Sometimes, looking at a specific moment in time, the feeling have a "color" to it, of wanting the experience or of not wanting it. Sometimes, it could be viewed by comparing a current feeling to a previous feeling, that we had a "better"/"worse" feeling.
In this case it is weird, because at the moment we feel this comparing, but it happens in the new moment. There is no way to get the wheel back to the past. Still, at any moment in time one can think of some kind of ordering of a list of feelings (there is also the problems with feelings that had never been felt, such as giving birth [for women], being high/without ego [e.g. after LSD/psylosibin use]).
So my current understanding is that for each "person", for each moment there is a subjective feeling. Each subject disappears in the moment right after it, and the subject of the next moment starts its (very short) life. There is a deep connection between them - the subject of moment $t+\epsilon$ inherits more or less the body (and mind) of that of moment $t$. There may be also a feeling of empathy between them. Also the mechanisms of their monds are wuite similar. There are inherited memories, habits and so on (in the sense that they are encoded in the inherited body). Each one may "choose" (also an ill defined term) to help the next-time subject.

Maybe I'll write more here sometime.
