There are certain dynamics. When something has enough influence, it can cause what-perceived-as-damage to another entity even though it somehow holds a mechanism of self defense. This, unless the mechanisms of defense or restrain are more powerful then that of the "influencer" (this came out as a bit of a complex sentence with too much hand waving, unfortunately). I don't see any way to get around this.
For example, think of the "first" contacts of humans from the asia-europe-africa area with the life in America. I see contacts because there were 2 notable ones. The first, happening about 13K yrs ago, humans in the last glacial period crossed Siberia to Alaska, and arrived at America. It didn't took long (I guess hundreds of yrs? It might be better to check this number) until humans spread all over the continent. And there is also a very strong evidence of the sudden disappearance of large animals from all over the continent, with about some large percentage of the animals going extinct (It might be better to check this number). Humans arrriving didn't hate the animals there, and aimed directly at their suffering and extinction. It just happened, and nothing could stop it. The animals didn't grow evolutionary along humans (as animals in the other continents), and they didn't have dynamics of defense against this extremely powerful entity. Sometimes humans wanted to eat, sometimes to get clothed, sometimes the animals just annoyed them, maybe. Even if might be that there was a real intent of making some animals go extincct for some reason, and it may be not. What is known for sure, is that this gap in power, with some power "aimed" at a direction of an entity, without any dynamic of protection or defence of the entity (even if natural/not concious/happens by "other" entities), and with the power "hard" enough, can cause disruption in the regular habitual dynamics of the entity, and may cause what is perceived as damage or death. It is the same as would a mega astroid come to earth, witho no technology to stop. The second time "new" humans arrived at America began in 1492, as we all know. And also this time, the European men arriving caused what is perceived as a great damage to the local population. It too happened because of this imbalanced power without any restrain or dynamic causing it to co exist with the living entities there.

But we can also look at what happens all over history, until today. For example, we can view the dynamic of the modern culture of maximizing profit, with humans connected to this information, with a powerful array of tools and technology to aid, which causes other communities of humans and animals to get damage, and also cause an irreversible damage to the nature and taking unsustainably materials from the earth, which will cause harm to next generations of humans.

Until now I discussed misalignment of a intelligent "entities" relative to other entities. But we can also look at misalignment caused inside an en entity. For example the mechanism of addiction- the human (or animal) is clearly suffering, because some part of his brain/dynamics causes a dynamic of addiction, and this dynamic "does not care" from the human's actual long term happiness.

So we have this problem for many years.
It is important to note that the "misalignment" causes damage to one damage-aware entity at one specific time (we could talk about many such instances at the same time, but that is the atom of the "damage").
The interesting question, is where there is no "misalignment"? 
So we want a dynamic to be such that the entity in a specific moment won't perceive any damage in the broad sense. This, for as much moments as possible, and to as much entities as possible.
Really? who cares from other entities? I may care by formulating this, but we could have formulate another problem. Or each entity could formulate for itself his definition of the problem.

I got into a rabbit hole, I might come back to here later.
