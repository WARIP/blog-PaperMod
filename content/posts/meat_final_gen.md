We are viewing here meat as a product. Apparently many people are using it, for many generations, hence it surely yields wellbeing of some sort. It also has costs of various kinds.


Viewing meat as a product, we can view the the production process as having some kinds of costs, and some kinds of yields- a 1kg of output has yield of types $(A_i)_i$ of values $(x_i)_i$ (in general form). It is not very exact, but we could summarize the yield as a kg of some kind of animal's meat, versus the cost which is measured by $. Therefore, we would like to maximize kg/$. There several kinds of new meat production processes (meat-like products produced from plants, and meat generated from real cells), but for our discussion we could just treat these as the extent to which a kg of each one gives the value of 1 kg of meat, in each relevant aspect. Then, we would like to compare for each aspect the ratio kg/$.


Up to this day, animals were a crucial participant in the process of meat production. They use several kinds of resources, to some extent (differing between different types of animals), and give yield to certain amount of "wellbeing" to some people. 
As I see it, we can look at all the possible meat production processes that could ever exist. My claim is that meat production through animals is probably not the "best" physically possible, where "best" in the sense we viewed before (relative to aspects $(A_i)_i$). Why? we can view animals as a production line for that matter. But each kg of meat, requires a living creature to carry it around and to grow it. It requires food, water, energy for the brain, guts, legs, harware for survival in nature. But an animal is just one way of producing. Maybe there is a way of production were 100% of the energy, food and water go to the meat itself? and the job of helping the growth of the meat in the production line is done by some process. I totally see how there are processes which are more efficient in that sense.

Therefore, in the future we will probably reveal ways that are ten-folds more efficient (up to some physical constraints) for meat production, without animals- with better taste, higher nutritional value, and with less cost. Today we don't know of a better way than using animals, therefore an R&D process is needed here.
