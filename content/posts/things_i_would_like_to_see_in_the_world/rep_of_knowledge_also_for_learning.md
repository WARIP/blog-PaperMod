So there are some motives and "challenges" processed here-
1. to be in learning mode with a lot of bits per second processed and incorporated to the brain with this feeling of growing, for as many moments as possible
2. Interest in the question of compressing the world's information, with all of the insights of many amazing minds, given the way this information is menifested in the world.
3. There are wonderful texts, videos and also just walking minds, with a wonderful way of seeing and represnting information that I would love to learn, but the current access most of the times cause not learning it as wished, and as I think is theoretically possible.

Maybe a map to travel in, but where this map is actually the information, will be intersting (it is still very much ill defined right now).
Spltting this whole information to atoms of knowledge might be possible. Then, connecting the atoms to create a graph/topology. Then, having a travel between points just according to the topology, which makes the information interested in the most available with the least effort in handling much larger cognitive burden.

To be processed more and maybe edited.
