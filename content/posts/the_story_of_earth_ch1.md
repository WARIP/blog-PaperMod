After a conversation about geology, a friend suggested me to check Robert Hazen's book "The Story of Earth". It is just fascinating that all of these processes exist (and moreover, that we also exist and able to observe this).
Here I will write about thoughts that came during the introduction and the first chapter.

## Introduction
- We are amazingly lucky to have such a universe, with such laws of physics, such that all of these processes occur as they are, so that there is life, which then can think (!), and specifically about this situation.
- \[After the author mentioned Eratothenes\] A human (or an intelligent entity) can do a lot with enough intelligence, even with poor equipment, but used in a smartly chosen manner.
- In a high enough probability, life pays the price on the change occuring on Earth.
- The time scales are enormously big, relative to our perception of time, so we are actually like in a very thrilling video with extreme views and stunts, living in one frame , which seems like a frozen moment.
- It is amazing that there was enough pressure and heat allowing the creation of atoms other then hydrogen (and even more amazingly atoms bigger then iron).
- In the first stars, the energy released from nuclear fusion and the pressure due to gravity balanced each other, but when the "fuel" was finished (no nuclear energy can be received from fusing iron), the imbalance caused a collapse and then an explosion that allowed the creation of atoms past iron.
- "History is repeated"- as atoms are recycled, with stars forming from the remains of previous stars, then dying, and again.
- All the planets in the solar system are situating near the same disk, and with similar axes of spinning, which probably implies that all of the solar system was originated from the same spinning disk of matter.
- The planets in the solar system are 4 rocky planets, and then 4 gas giants, which probably implies that in the beginning of the sun, solar wind blew far away hydrogen and helium, and also "rocky" matter which got less far. Then these clouds of matter/gas clumped together due to gravity, which created the planets.
