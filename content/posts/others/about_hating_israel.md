Socialism is weird. It seems like one should support the poor and victims. But what if they do choose their ways? And the help they get make them adapt? It makes them unaccountable. It makes the bad and unsustainable idealogies to keep on going and thriving, because they get more resources, *because* they are inproductive!!! Moreover, when the money distribution is done by states and not by individuals, that's actually stealing, because they take money from me without my approval and spend it on unsustainable ways of living. 
The rich west forgot how to fight. Forgot that there are people which are much less rich but much more willing to take. "Palestinians" is a great example. Instead of taking care for their life, everyone tells them that they are the victim, and deserve resources. They don't need to work them, others are accountable for them. To give their land back. Until then, they should cry and fight. Not create wealth, not help others. but fight. This, together with Islam's unwillingness for thinking objectively, has huge consequences.
Israel is an easy target, because it is different and small enough to make an enemy of it. Making an enemy of the US is harder, because it is so big and powerful. Same for Russia and Chiina. But It is a known strategy to choose an enemy that you can kill with enough effort and stay alive.

Some facts:
- "Palestine" was the name of the region, named by the Romans in 136 when they conquered it and expelled the Jews after the extreme of them did some problems. For the thousand+ years beforehand, it was called the land of Israel, and the region around Jerusalem named Judea. The reference- Josephus Plavius's texts, the bible.
- Mohammad took great inspiration from the bible in the invention of Islam.
- Arabs don't know how to really work or be productive- is there any product that is created by any Arab country, which is not oil/gas (extracted from the ground)? A product that is used daily by people all over the world. I don't know of any.
