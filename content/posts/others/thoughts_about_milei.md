This is the info I am considering:
- Javier Milei as an academic background in economy (BSc/MSc/tutor in economics)
- From here, quotes taken from Carlson's interview-
- Argentina started embracing "socialist" ideas 100 years, and then it started its decline.
- "When there is a need, there is a right. But there are finite resources, and someone has to pay for these "rights". Liberalist economy found a way to resolve this conflict- through private property and economic freedom. Socialist don't like the invisible hand of the market, but the claws of the state, which are actually unjst and based on robbery.".
- There are problems that come to be from decisions from people (e.g. regarding women's lower salary). Always when the state intervenes it is not via addressing the core causes, but by violent action which results in violation of private property and freedom, and worsens the situation, e.g. regarding women. for example, there are decisions women and men make.
- Considering abortion- the woman as a right on her body, but the to-be-born-child is not a part of her body, and there is an imbalance of power where he\she cannot defend themselves.

- Milei's comical video where he takes out all the 


More of my observations:
- The state should do only what 90% of people want.
- There is an important concept of self accountability.
- There is no morality. No objective morality, no "should" or "need". The best world is where people take accountability of their actions and selves, and with economic freedom can gain higher welfare to society by cooperation and transactions based on productivity and how they help the other.


This info needs to be received, and how will will it be used:
- What *exactly/mainly* got Argentina to its state of decline?

Thoughts:
- What about grand infrastructure planning? To what extent should that be under the state's reponsibility
