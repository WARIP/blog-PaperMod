Sometimes the mind doesn't think deeply. And it sells ideas to others, and to oneself. Very unclear here what do I mean by "selling ideas", also to me. Trying to give more meaning to it, it alternatively could be viewed as part of the thinking process included in a social justification. Another alternative is what constitutes to think not with a "selling" mindset.
