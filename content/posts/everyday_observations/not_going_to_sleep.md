It happens so many times. An urge to do something keeps me awake. "I have to finish this! I have to solve that right now!" are some words that pop up in 2:28. And I know from experience, that nothing good happens at this hour, at this level of sleepiness. A long enough sleep is also more healthy and more productive than anything I can do right now, especially as a strategy for not only this night.

The cause of it, in my opinon, is a lower level of rationality occuring at this level of sleepiness. A level that cause two problems - not productive thoughts and actions, and also a lack of rational assessment of the situation hand. There are probably more insightful sentences that could be written here, but I am too tired and I had to write this right now before I go to sleep.
