Now, I had a motivation to do a specific thing. More specifically, to finish reading a chapter from a book I read together with a group, so that I will be more ready before with some time to think about the material (instead of reading at the last minute as, unfortunately, happened too many times), and moreover because it is a thing I wanted to learn through, anyway.

But, came to my mind some urge. Some distancing urge, pulling me out. It took seconds, and almost without notice my mind came to another realm, actually a quite known one- of getting reminded of other "liabilities", and holding on. Trying to judge. WIn the past when it used to happen, I thought to myself that my mind goes through a process of optimization, and for optimization it is good to consider the different liabilities, the levels of their importance and their impact. Then I saw other people that seem to go through much more experiences in their daily lives, more intended experiences with being more active and more absorbed in a good sense in the moment. And in them, I see no considerations. Just almost automatically moving. Swift as the wind, passing through thoughts and fixating on some. And also them, when having to choose between conflicting motives, can have a local stagnation. So what is happening here? Why is it so automatic? It seems like a burden from destiny, but is it? Can I have in some close future the opportunity to have it less, much less, or in a negligable fraction of the time? How does a mind that swiftly as the wind go through what I initially perceive as decisions, look like from inside? Learning, morphing the mindly habit to a habit of being swift, easy and light, how does it feel?

I have the feeling that there must be a sense of letting go. Or blindness. Fixating on an object in the mind, and exploring it like a child- playing in the sandbox that is in fromt of me, in the broad sense. This includes being light, and curious. And letting go, give the curiousity the control. Not just control, give the curiousity full control. Give the love full control. Give these innocent motivations full control. Having an adult mind, with considerations of identity and status and a perception of obligations. So sad, I wish there would not be this feeling of an adult mind in this sense. There is a very very good thing that comes with it, which is a kind of maturity, of looking at the world and seeing through the apparent appearances of it- seeing other peoples' minds and motives, seeing through the bullshit and seeing pure and impressive information, having the ability to navigate the social map in a better way then a child, seeing opportunities and understand how the world works. These are wonderful, highly non trivial. This with the way of a child-like losing control and giving the primal "good" instincts of love, empathy and curiousity to take control. And will we stay alive without the protective measures that come in the thoughts about what other people will think? I guess that in an emergency case, one would know how to handle.

Now that I think about it, I see that it may be that this a draft which may be never edited. Or edited with feeling bad of throwing things, as happened to me so much. And even though there is a possibility to save. I see now a post I have written before, that feels a bit wrong to me. Why? There is this feeling of being not mature. But also not representative. I wrote it in some other urge, and too slow and too distant. And it is funny, now that I think about it. Also here- the feeling of impossibility of throwing away. Leaving only good things. Or at least, what bothers, throw. The instinct of saving is important when it is a physical tool and we are in the jungle. Here we are in the digital backed-up-on-cloud era. But also if it may be important. For example in the case of considering other options, other alternatives to what to focus on. There is an actual loss. But not really- in any case it would not be possible to enjoy at the same time from the both advantages. Moreover, in this process the main fixing is on the act of considering which is just horrible- unnatural and causing confusion and distancing away, in some way I don't have words to explain right now.
 
This is a first draft.

(I have the impression that my english is not the best here)
