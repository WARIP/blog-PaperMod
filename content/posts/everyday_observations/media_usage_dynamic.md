update- I discovered a very nice way to reduce dramatically unwanted time on the web- to have the screen in colors in greyscale! It is a very good way to reduces the "dopamin hit" that comes without mindless surfing.

A certain dynamic became almost a habit for me, unfortunately. I am waking, thinking about all of the good stuff I am going to do today. Then, some uncomfortable feelings come to mind, sometimes with words and sometimes without. When they are with words, they tell some story about a certain doubt, standing in a position of decision, or of some liability. And my brain explodes. In such a moment of confusion, a little thought is crawling the back of the mind just an urge, a feeling of something missing in my hand, some beautiful red rectangle, or a blue-ish bird, or a blue rectangle which invites you in, or reading the news at some platform or another about some issue. And in my mind, this voice has a much easier way of gratification - it is a matter of seconds, or minutes, to gratify this urge- to just check. The deep thoughts feel like very hard to solve and to bear, and I know they will be solved afterwards. Throwing the responsibility on the future, mindlessly. Then, in a moment of weakness, I just enter the phone to check this thing. Sometimes it is for something "good", like answering a friend on Whatsapp or scheduling something using emails. Nevertheless, once inside, the dynamic traps you. A dynamic of on a rollercoaster- some photo or sentence intriguing an active grabbing thought on some plan or some curiousity-grabbing click bait (a la "This is what *X* told *Y*"). Then clicking, and then a new rollercoaster. This, with vibrant colors (when the screen is not configured to be in greyscale).

And it is really sad, because somehow this little dive became a true drowning, lasting between 20 minutes to 4 hours in a row (!). It is absorving any youth, any health, any meaning, any happy feelings nor sad, any original or productive thoughts. Sometimes there are actually some interesting thoughts during this drowning, but for the most part the brain becomes almost totally passive, and being submissimive to what the finger will reveal next on the little screen.
Really, a life could be past this way. I am pretty ashamed to count the number of hours I have spent on these platforms.

Many people have gone through a similar situation. There are several billions of phone users around the world, who probably experience similar difficulties.

I hope there would be phones, tablets and computers centered around minimizing this effect. Really, a benevolent device with actions taken to protect. It is really possible, and it would be worth to pay more for it (at least I know it about myself).
