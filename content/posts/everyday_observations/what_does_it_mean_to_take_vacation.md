I hear this sentence a lot, "take a vacation", "I'm going on a vacation". And I wonder, What a vacation is made of? There are ways to "go on a vacation" that are societal acceptable, and often may allow a quiet-from-restrains mind about thinking of this. The societal sense is obvious, each culture and time and its own culturally accepted symbols that when said, leads to "Oh, very nice!" or "Great that you are taking a vacation" or "I want to have a vacation like that". And a vacation as viewed from the "vacating" entity, may also constitute of a mind full of other things and thoughts, with the thinking dynamics which corresponds to societal acceptability. 
Nevertheless, it is surprisingly not occuring to me enough to think deeply on how does a real vacation looks like, or that I want one (want in a deep sense, not a momentarily shallow "wanting" [what does that even mean?]).
A real vacation in general could be viewed as "good" time. But really good time- time that in most moments during and after, is remembered as pure joy, of some form or another. As way of getting out of habits with damages such as stress and worry. It may be a good definition- a time without worry and stress as much as possible. There may be good periods of time with implicated stress or worry, as a part of a feeling of impactful job and of being necessary to something important.

Here is a list of things that come to my mind when thinking of a vacation for me:
- aiming in the mind to have a real vacation- to deserve mindless and free enjoy for some period of time.
- being deeply immersed in reading something (this could be done for sometimes short streches of time)
- Free interaction with nice-to-be-around-at-the-moment people
- live the material desires, with a free mind (as eating, sleeping)

I may write here more somewhere.
