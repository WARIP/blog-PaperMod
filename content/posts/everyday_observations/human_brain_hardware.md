So many times a day it strikes me how my hardware is vulnerable. How impactful the effects of ego, foregetting, mindlessness, irrational emotional processing and much more. 
One example is that when the thing my mind attends to is "jumping", then there is a large loss, in the sense that when having focus, the mind can later compress this information and allow a nicer feeling while thinking about these, while having thoughts with more information content per moment (because of the compression).
I sometimes wonder how does it feel like to have less of one of the vulnerabilities mentioned, trying to get into a mind like this.
I hope there will be technologies (in the broad sense) better helping with these vulnerabilities, in favor of the person.
For example, for the problem of jumping between subjects I see this "blog" as a part of a temporary solution.
