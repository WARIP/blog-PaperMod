I tend to dream. A lot. Seeing the world. Then understanding something deep. Then having a huge motivation to have some thing exist in the real world. Sometimes it is for personal gratification, and sometimes it feels it is going to be important also for a small or large group of other people. And then the mind goes to dream. 

There is probably a second of thought about the actuality of it. Of acting. At the first step some misknowledge get in the way. Some seemed hurdle. And also the physical world is quire. Probably if someone would talk about it nearby me, it will make acting more probable. But there is quiet outside. And the mind tries to capture it all, but theexpansion in memory and number of possible paths is exponential, truly exponential. And shortly after that there is a stack overflow, and the mind that was in the acting mode moves quickly to the dreaming mode, as it is a heavy burden. Probably calling a friend, or start poking the next-to-me person about it would help. A way to hold the memory. To stay up to the challenge of handling this amount of information and processing. Due to some form of a strong habit I am usually reluctant to speak with others. Due to some strong habit I am reluctant to act in the physical world imidietly, when things are unclear in the mind. And they usually never become clear, because of the memory and processing constraint I have mentioned. And it collapses without sharing another hardware with the effort. Stop speaking, stop dreaming. Just process and enjoy running. Running is much more fun then sitting and imagining running. It is like playing music, or playing some sport - only by doing you feel the intricacies of actual living. Of actually lifting a ball and watch from a first person perspective its trajectory, or listening to certain special melodies and harmonies and musical moments. Or by going through a problem, allowing seeing the beautiful math unfolds. Life could be beautiful as long as the processing and acting continues. 
It is okay to do it unperfectly. To have in the mind only 0.00001% of the information needed to fulfill the imagined idea to the best way, to have only $\eps$ of the processing power to have things perfectly. Here comes also the ilusion of having to do everything now. The mind has a wonderful way of compression. After time and repeatition, the mind compresses and make the task much easier. More could enter the working memory then before. The dictionary of the mind actions used for this kind of processing becomes more compressed, allowing a higher level of performance. Performance not just for others, but also to the enjoyment of oneself. The best fun starts after enough mindful repeatitions where the mind flows freely in the space of information and actions. Relaxing is required. Letting go is required. It just happens, and it just needed to be patient and act ordinarily. Letting in the nice thoughts, the urges you know inside unconsciously that will bring you happiness. Letting in the judgeing thoughts on the not helpful atoms-of-thought, and Letting them dissolve. A child can do these things. Not "can", just does, as a way of an instinct. I wish I could be a child in this sense. 
There are people that I see that act freely. act as children. letting the ideas flow, the processing be as it is, and comming back to repeat second after second the wonderful micro-urges. This may culminate in a beautiful form of output, or just letting you see their state of flow from the side. I saw people like that, who do it day after day. This is also the difference between the regular and the 10X or 100X engineers, or in general acting people from all paths of life. There are grandmas that have the energy and the power of an army. There are people who get to live out of an instinct and be mindful with friends, be present in sport, and having their life be filled with some form of object. It is an art of letting things appear. And with it, lletting the urges of body cause physical movement, in the real world. Being mindfully automatic. I would love to be as automatic as them, and mindful. There are also people that it just seems like all of their actions are mindful. A person who acts, who works, who get things done, who have a rich social life, rich enough. And having fun.
Letting go is the key, in the most full sense of it- letting the mind move at the pace of its urges, letting the fingers, hands, legs and face to follow. Living in this instinctive way, with respecting the outer world and others and oneself and having fun flow out in the subjective world seems like a wonderful way of living. And it seems possible. I would really like to have a way to get there. I have a faint memory of some insights from the "waking up" app that may help here if acted upon without limits.
