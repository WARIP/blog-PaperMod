I once thought that I can think about things, to just think. To discover ideas, by being alone in the head. That's impossible. It is much easier to write. Symbolizing the thought, which is very weird by itself- how does it that words and symbols as output are used to change so dramatically the way we later perceive the world, relative to without it?

So symbolizing is like technology. Also language by itself in thinking. is symbolizing. Without it, what is rest? Trying to be, without language, in a regular state of mind, is meaningful in some sense.

Sometimes using symbols destructs the mind-construction that was in the mind. It may be write to say that there are certain kinds of mind constructions which 

Language is such a complex technology. It is possible to forget how to use it. Once we will have mind reading machines we may not need to use language of any sort with other technology. Maybe also with other humans, but to communicate with them we will need to at  least understand language (in case of mind-reading machines and not mind-writing machines, so the writing process will be through language).
