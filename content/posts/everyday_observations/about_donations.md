Donations seem as only for very altruistic purposes, for empathazing with some group of people who suffer, and that can't get care for themselves (as poor, ill, children, etc.). In this sense it is obviously a great tool (up to the way of donating, one may research about effective altruism to understand more...). 

I think it is also very useful to see donations in a selfish way, where we look at selfish also in a broader horizon. Donation is a signal to a person or a group "please keep on what you do, and if you recur some loss you can earn back these X$". This signal increasing the probability and intensity of the actions by this specific person/group. At least for me this changed the picture a little bit, to see in a broader eye donations- there are many times where it is not directly to empathasize, but it does help you and also many other people, in a way that sometimes is not so clearly empathy-driven, and as long it is not on the back of another large group it will be also good that it will be acceptable by the society. 

There is a gray area of politics and donating to a party, which is not very clear but I won't get into now.
