First of all, initially I wanted to use the name "work in progress" for the blog, but apparently this name is already used, by [some blog about sociology](http://www.wipsociology.org/). Hence "work in progress 01" seemed fit.

I am trying to think clearly. Just wander in a beautiful imagined world of information, of math or interesting ideas, or just seeing the mechanisms behind the world and my specific world in a clearer way. But, it is hard. 

Why is it hard?
- Sometimes I forget. Sometimes the working memory is just finite- and when getting to the RAM limit (which I would love to be higher), the discussion in my head becomes less fun.
- The concentration span is not just finite, but short enough so that it also causes the discussions in my head to be less fun.
- Sometimes I am trying to get into my mind after several hours/days/weeks/years, and also then the memory in my mind annoyingly misses parts. This also makes the discussion in the head less fun.
- Sometimes I would like to discuss a topic with other people, and then when my mind is cluttered but I do remember that I had some interesting thoughts about the topic, I don't remember them, and the discussion which is also in the outer world becomes less fun.

Moreover, it is another good way to think (as Paul Graham also mentioned sometime, and he is right). Thinking only in the head or in conversations has a huge disadvantage in the sense of the working memory, relative to writing. Even though this memory sometimes have a not small complexity of querying, it is still better then inifinity.

There is an option of talking with other people but they are not always handy, and also sometimes I feel more comfortable with talking to a paper-like thing when the mind is cluttered to some degree.

Twitter may be fit here, but not exactly - here it is easier to stay anonymous (until my identity will be revealed somehow), and it is also not real time with less exposure (especially now when there is 0 exposure).

I had the idea of a blog in the back of my mind for some years, but thankfully a person I know ep has started a blog with some nice technical posts, which gave me the view of the possibility of it as an actuality and not as a "dream".

Until we will have a comfortable enonugh to use brain-computer interface of high bandwidth and with the possibility of transfering thoughts, this seems to be a solution which will be nice.
