First of all, initially I wanted to use the name "work in progress" for the blog, but apparently this name is already used, by [some blog about sociology](http://www.wipsociology.org/). Hence "work in progress 01" seemed fit.

I am trying to think clearly. Just wander in a beautiful imagined world of information, of math or interesting ideas, or just seeing the mechanisms behind the world and my specific world in a clearer way. But, it is hard. 

Why is it hard?
- Sometimes I forget. Sometimes the working memory is just finite- and when getting to the RAM limit (which I would love it to be higher), the discussion in my head becomes less fun.
- The concentration span is not just finite, but short enough so that it also causes the discussions in my head to be less fun. The combination of forgetting and a short concentration span cause a degrading performance in the brain's ability to compress information, and so reduces the fun of thinking (as thinking is fun in correlation with the information-content per moment).
- Sometimes I am trying to get into my mind after several hours/days/weeks/years, and also then the memory in my mind annoyingly misses parts. This also makes the discussion in the head less fun.
- Sometimes I would like to discuss a topic with other people, and then when my mind is cluttered but I do remember that I had some interesting thoughts about the topic, I don't remember them, and the discussion which is also in the outer world becomes less fun.

Moreover:
- It is another good way to think (as Paul Graham also mentioned somewhere, and he is right). Thinking only in the head or in conversations has a huge disadvantage in the sense of the working memory, relative to writing. Even though this memory sometimes have a not small complexity of querying, it is still smaller then practically-inifinity.
- There is an option of talking with other people but the observed dynamic and states causes uncomforability with the thought of having such discussions. Also sometimes when I do try to get into such discussions and this kind of open mind, the dynamic doesn't follow there (maybe it would be possible with "better" trying by the means accessible to me, maybe not).
- Sometimes I feel more comfortable with talking to a paper-like thing when the mind is cluttered to some degree, as its quietness, receptiveness and ability to edit are may help.
- I can think partly a thought, stop whenever there is a local feeling of exhaustion, and then continue later.

About this blog as a form of "solution" (there may be a better word then solution to this):

Twitter may be fit here, but not exactly:
 - here it is easier to stay anonymous (until my identity will be revealed somehow), and it is also not real time with less exposure (especially now when there is 0 exposure). 
 - Twitter with cluttered with all of the world's twitter-like information.
 - Twitter doesn't allow this easy way of frequent editing and restructuring of the whole information tree as here (but there might be better ways).

I had the idea of a blog in the back of my mind for some years, but thankfully a person I know ep has started a blog with some nice technical posts, which gave me the view of the possibility of it as an actuality and not as a "dream".

The best solution would be comfortable-enonugh-to-use brain-computer interface of high bandwidth and with the possibility of transfering thoughts (which not yet exists:)).

Still-to-process thoughts about these motives and "solutions":

I still feel that I am not completely open here, so e.g. moving to a site with usernames and passwords and tiers of access, with github repo being private. On the other side, there is this motive of being completely transparent, which causes a very empowering feeling once accessed.

Possible currently-very-possible-to-make upgrades to this type of solution (to the problem presented above):
- Having a podcast to read the thoughts, with emphasis on the process of reading the thoughts aloud, so to have a clearer view of them and further deeply process them.
- Conversing with chatgpt-like agents using the written here, in some form.
