A gratitude that so many things exist, as closed houses, social structures and mindsets allowing a high security where I am (e.g. to eat outdoors and rest), air conditioning, the internet as connecting me with a lot of meaningful and mind changing information that I wouldn't get otherwise, on language, on the mathematical constructions, on how fortunate I am to learn math and playing piano from a relatively young age, and pretty much consistently, for the people who love me and for the people I love (~=appreciate the moments near them, their thoughts and feelings and their existence), for the diet that is built on so many deaths in the past millions of years.
