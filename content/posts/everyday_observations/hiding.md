### My hiding
Not fulfilled. And not comfortable in bearing it in public. With no hide, if being in public. What are you up to? real answer e.g. "belly aches. moving like a zombie between a room to another. sometimes on the phone or computer, reactive to a panic passing. Much of the momentum from the young age is lost. So many promises unfulfilled." 

The options are to answer completely honest, or not.

### (General) People's hiding, its way of menifastation and consequences
Also, Most of the time, people's output (text, speech) is very much driven by hiding and showing some useful mask to the outer world, and it is not clear at first glance.
