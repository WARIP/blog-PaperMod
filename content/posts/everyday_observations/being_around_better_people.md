I get to be near better people then me. They are smarter, more creative, more productive, make a better social atmosphere, have higher confidence than me. It is not comfortable. When this feeling appears in its full form, it pulls taste out of the endeavors. "He won't find any gain in explaining it to me slowly and give me the time and place to understand", "Everyone knows that he is doing it better. ", "I am not worth these resources."

At first glance, that shouldn't bother at all, in case where we are not competing on the same essential resource to life. Rationally speaking, the best strategy would be to enjoy their company, as it is much more special than that of other people, and the interactions will be more interesting and productive. It feels weird to write about that, but I am sure that almost everyone have these thoughts on some kinds of environments. 
Maybe I'll write here more later.
