Currently I participate in learning groups which include reading a textbook, one chapter at each week, and in the meeting discussing the important points and maybe solving exercises.
It seems like it is not so straight forward. I personally had some non useful habits in approaching this, and I learned a little bit how to handle it. Of course there is a lot of room for improvements.
Bad habits and solutions for them:
- getting stuck:
  - The problem: start reading, then getting stuck on some not understandable sentence early on, then 1 hour later remaining stuck on it and finishing only ~1 page.
  - A solution: In short- keep going on, and denote with a symbol/words that you don't understand this point (even that happens at a high rate while reading). The key is to understand that there is a future, in which the brain might have access to the state which allows understanding, where after some amount of effort it might not come at this moment. So, while reading, when a point is not understood, after some moments of thinking on it, if there seems to be no local progress, I just denote with some symbol that I did not understand this point (and maybe write it actually with words, on the paper/pdf file in the tablet/a special google docs file for this) and move on. It is amazing how the majority of these points are getting understood almost immediately at some point after the first reading. Another part of the solution is to start the reading at least one day before the meeting, so to give a chance for a 2nd reading before the meeting. Another thing to understand is that in the meeting a lot more is understood, so when you are alone a main goal should be, if not to understand fully the material, to prepare yourself so that you will get the most out of the meeting. This means to understand well the definitions and theorems' statements, and then the constuctions and claims done during the proof at some level.
- feeling clueless:
  - The problem: during the meeting, have a kind of a blackout
  - A Solution: skim through the material in the hour before the meeting
- getting mad at oneself for reading too slow, feeling the burden and procrastinating
  - The problem: as stated. 
  - The solution: understand that this is a polished presentation of the proof, usually without the imagery that was in the mind of people who thought about this, and you need to make in your mind this same vivid and dynamic construct, out of black static symbols of letters on a paper. So, the point is that it will take time. The time it takes to read a page might be much larger then reading any other type of text you are used to read. For me I discovered that it is best to have a time estimate on how much it will take me to read one pass of a page (I remind you that it is best to not put all of your expectations from the first pass). Then before reading, I have in my mind the time alloted to reading and a realistic estimate for how much I will read during this time. And even though it seems like too little, it is realistic and this is very important and helping in the process.
