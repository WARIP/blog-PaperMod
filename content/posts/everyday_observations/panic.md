Being panic could happen without notice. It moves the brain, the guts, the heart, feeling insecure in the body.
Sometimes it makes feel that there is a sense of it being "not OK", that there are people who better perform, more able and can also be without panic. Somehow handeling the feelings of obligations and preparings for a performance.
Panic is paralizing. It causes real digestion problems. 
How much is it useful? For me, looking backwards, it allowed a lot of progress, of working hard after procrastination, where otherwise I could keep procrastinating and not doing much at all. There are many times in which it had no use, only harm.
Panic visits me. Is it possible to live meaningful life without it? 
For me, there is a panic where a sense of obligation arises. An obligation in a specific sense (no words for it right now). 

I'm imagining living without stress. Without panic. So there must be a feeling of power and security, in any case. With any appearance, with any consequence.

This is a temporary try.
