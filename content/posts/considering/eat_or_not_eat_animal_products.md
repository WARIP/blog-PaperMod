To eat or not to eat meat. Here are some considerations:

Why to eat:
- It is tasty and stimulate and satisfyies the senses.
- It is very cultural ingrained (many social activities are based on, and it is the cultural consenzus)
- Easy to make and to keep a diet with, taking nutrition and effort into account
- There is a huge database of examples of diets which include animal based products, evolved for the order of ~$10^6$ of years of almost inifintely many kinds, with almost no such known paths for vegan diets.

Why not to eat:
- There is animal suffering caused by it (called the "moral" argument).
- It is not the most efficient way to feel the nutritional need of a human (called the "ecological" argument).


The aruguments above are written as facts but have some degree of probability of being false.

I was 95% vegan since 26/05/2017 - the only animal products I ate since then are a few free-ranch eggs a week, two times chicken meat, and 3 times fish a week for 2 months, and a handful of times dairy products.

# Thinking through the "moral" argument

There are two different aspects related- 
- To what extent animal X feels pain of kind Y in the process of making the product Z
- Does one care about it

I think that it is important to consider the first one more thoroughly (also because in the first one we have relatively little knowledge about the specifics).

Concerning the first argument, actually there is no objective consequence of causing suffer to other animals or people. There is a subjective consequence in the sense of the emotional empathy or justice, and in a sense of a selfish gain. For example, there is a selfish gain from not making people as slaves, because they might some day get mad at me and kill me. So for other humans it is clear why it is selfish to cause only proportional pain and probably the best way is to make the pain caused to others to a minimum (up to some situations, but let's put that aside).



Viewing animal products in relation to the kind of animal itself, surely there is some kind of difference between the different kinds - from fish to cows. As I see it, mammalians have a brain which very much resembles the human brain in the emotional functionalities. Even though they don't have a cortex, based on this similarity in the brain structure I am sure that the emotional world of love, fear and sexual desire are similar to a human. Looking at other forms of life than mammlians, they too seem to have some form of pain perception.
